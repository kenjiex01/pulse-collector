## 1. Getting Started

### Desktop app (client deployment)

Pulse ships as a **single installer** — no separate PHP, MySQL, or web server setup.

| Platform | Installer |
|----------|-----------|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `Pulse-<version>-arm64.dmg` |
| Windows | `Pulse-<version>-setup.exe` |

**First launch**

1. Double-click the Pulse app icon.
2. The app creates its local database automatically (SQLite).
3. Migrations and reference data run in the background.
4. The login screen opens when ready.

> **macOS unsigned builds:** If the app is blocked, right-click → **Open**, or allow it in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.

### Development / browser access

For internal testing, developers can run `php artisan serve` and open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

---

## 2. Signing In

Open Pulse and enter your email and password on the sign-in screen.

![Login screen](images/01-login.png)

| Field | Desktop default (first install) |
|-------|----------------------------------|
| Email | `superadmin@icct.edu.ph` |
| Password | `Password123!` |

- Check **Remember me** to stay signed in on the same machine.
- Click **SHOW** to reveal the password while typing.
- Contact your administrator if you cannot sign in or need access to more modules.

---

## 3. Navigation

After login, the **sidebar** on the left lists all modules you are allowed to access.

![Dashboard with sidebar](images/02-dashboard.png)

| Area | What you see |
|------|----------------|
| **Search modules** | Filter the sidebar by module name |
| **Administration** | Dashboard, User Management, Role Management, Database |

| **Timekeeping** | Policy, Time Logs, Employee Profile, Employee Load |
| **Payroll** | Rate Definition, Maintenance Table, Government Tables, Calendar, Transaction |
| **User footer** | Your name, role, and **Log out** |

### Modal-based actions

Most **Add**, **Edit**, and **View** actions open a **modal dialog** on the same page — the app does not navigate to a separate full-page form. Look for buttons such as **Add Employee**, **Upload**, or row **View / Edit** icons.

### Search and tables

List pages include:

- A **search box** (filters as you type)
- **Show: N per page** dropdown
- Row actions: **View**, **Edit**, **Delete** (when your role allows)

The Dashboard is your home screen after login.

- Total users and roles (administrators only)

**Quick access** (administrators) links to User Management, Role Management, and Database backup.

## 9. Common Tasks

### Run semi-monthly payroll (typical flow)

**Sa ngayon:** Hindi pa ginagamit ang **Time Logs** upload. Ang hours para sa payroll ay mula sa **Upload Adjustments → Hours Worked**.

1. **Employee Profile** — confirm shift, policy, holiday group, and rest days per employee.
2. **Payroll Transaction → Upload Adjustments → Hours Worked** — upload hours per employee for the pay period (Day Type, Time Type, No. of Hours). See sample image in Section 9.
3. **Payroll Transaction → Payroll Batches** — create batch for the correct semi-monthly period.
4. Add employees → **Process** → review **Net Pay** per employee.
5. **Reprocess** if you upload more hours or add manual adjustments.
6. **Post** when totals are correct.

**Kapag naka-enable na ang Time Logs:** Upload punches first; log hours merge with uploaded Hours Worked at **Process**.

### Add a new employee manually

1. **Human Resource → Employees → Add Employee**.
2. Complete campus and employee details in the wizard.
3. Go to **Timekeeping → Employee Profile** and run **Setup** for that employee.

### Grant a staff user access to Payroll only

1. **Role Management → Edit** (or create a role).
2. Enable **Payroll** sub-modules (view/create/update as needed).
3. **User Management → Edit** user → assign the role.

### Back up before desktop reinstall

1. **Database → Download Backup**.
2. Install the new Pulse version.
3. Restore data per your IT procedure (or contact support).

## 10. Tips & Troubleshooting

| Issue | What to try |
|-------|-------------|
| Empty pay type dropdown | Restart the desktop app — reference data auto-repairs on launch |
| Upload preview shows errors | Check campus codes, employee numbers, and type codes against lookup tables |
| Batch shows wrong hours/amount | Re-upload adjustments, then **Reprocess** the batch |
| Module missing from sidebar | Ask admin to check **Role Management** permissions |
| macOS blocks the app | Right-click app → **Open** once, then allow in Privacy & Security |

### Audit trail

All create, update, and delete actions are recorded in the system audit log (`sys_logs`) for accountability.

### Regenerating guide screenshots

Developers can refresh screenshots after UI changes:

```bash
cd pulse
node scripts/capture-user-guide-screenshots.mjs
```

Requires Google Chrome installed on the machine. Uses the running dev server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default.
